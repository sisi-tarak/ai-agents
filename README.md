Understanding AI Agents: Levels & Real-Life Examples
ðŸ”¹ Level 1: Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude respond to your input based on their training data.
Example:
- You input: 'Draft an email for a coffee chat.'
- LLM outputs a polite email.

Limitations:
1. No access to your personal data like calendar events.
2. LLMs are passiveâ€”they only respond to inputs.
ðŸ”¹ Level 2: AI Workflows
AI Workflows are sequences of steps pre-defined by a human to complete tasks using AI tools.
Example:
- You ask: 'When is my coffee chat?'
- Workflow checks your Google Calendar and returns the result.

Limitations:
- Can only follow predefined paths (control logic).
- Cannot adapt or reason outside the script.

Real Example:
- Google Sheets compiles news links
- Perplexity summarizes articles
- Claude drafts LinkedIn posts
- Scheduled daily at 8 AM
(Still manual if the result isnâ€™t good enough)
ðŸ”¹ Level 3: AI Agents
AI Agents are autonomous systems that can reason, act, and iterate to achieve a goal without human decision-making.
Key Capabilities:
1. Reason â€“ Decide the best method to achieve the goal.
2. Act â€“ Use tools effectively.
3. Iterate â€“ Improve outputs automatically.

Example:
- Task: Draft social posts from news articles.
- Agent decides best approach, accesses tools (Sheets, Perplexity, Claude), critiques and refines results until the best version is ready.

Framework Used: ReAct (Reason + Act)

Real Example:
- AI vision agent identifies â€˜skierâ€™ in a video without human tags, reasoning what a skier is, scanning frames, selecting the best clip.
ðŸ”š Final Summary
ðŸŸ¢ LLMs â€“ Input/output based, no decision-making.
ðŸŸ¡ Workflows â€“ Predefined logic paths set by humans.
ðŸ”´ AI Agents â€“ Autonomous systems that reason, act, and refine results.

Agents are the next step in AI evolution â€” shifting from tools we operate to assistants that operate for us.
